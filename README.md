# ReachOut Next.js boilerplate BETA
## A Next.js 14 starter template for dynamic content web applications
[ReachOut](https://reachoutapp.io) Next.js boilerplate is a free website starter template to deploy Next.js apps for marketing and content publishing. It is built with Next.js 14.1 and can be deployed to any hosting including Vercel which we recommend for ISR on-demand revalidation.

ReachOut is a platform that connects a dedicated marketing and content PostgreSQL database to multiple websites and email endpoints for dynamic content, analytics, tracking and more. It also provides a headless CMS that exposes all the content collections to a RestAPI.

The ReachOut Next.js boilerplate is the free starting point to build any content and dynamic web app on ReachOut. It can be styled, extended and implemented freely using the ReachOut SDK to fetch data from the ReachOut platform, or it can be easily converted to use any ORM like Prisma.

## ReachOut Next.js starter template features
